    "As  we know, friendship as social information, is probably useful to provide extra information of ourselves. Unfortunately,  we may have difficulties in collecting actual and accurate friendship network for an individual due to privacy policy and ambiguous definition of friendship. Nowadays, with the development digital technology, we have more digital check-ins using mobile phone. The check-ins datasets usually contain our basic information, for example, username or user ID, location or place ID, and check-in time.  Based on these check-in information, it is not difficult to extract the “meetupers” information for every users. Consequently, the question you probably ask, \n",

    "***Weeplace dataset***: a data visualisation application that allows users to visualise their check-ins on other LBSNs. Our data include more than 7 million check-ins produced by more than 15,000 Foursquare users visiting over 1 million locations in approximately 50,000 cities worldwide from Nov 2003 to Jun 2011. At the time the data was collected, users manually checked in to locations in order to earn points,  badges, and titles (e. q., \"mayor\") at locations they frequented, including their own homes. Foursquare also had hundreds of thousands of local businesses partners who offered incentives for checking in, such as discounts and free food. Together, these features incentivised frequent check-ins. The data we use here corresponds to the Foursquare users who have provided their data to the Weeplace service (now defunct) in order to create dynamic visualisations of their activities."
